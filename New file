Git is a distributed version control system. So, What is a Version Control System? 

A version Control system is a system that maintains different versions of your project when we work in a team or as an individual. (system managing changes to files) As 
the project progresses, new features get added to it. So, a version control system maintains all the different versions of your project for you and you can roll back
to any version you want without causing any trouble to you for maintaining different versions by giving names to it like MyProject, MyProjectWithFeature1, etc.
